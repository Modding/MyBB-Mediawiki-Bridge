/**
 * MyBB <-> MediaWiki Integration Modification
 *
 * This MediaWiki authentication module allows
 * you to integrate your MyBB user database
 * with MediaWiki
 *
 */

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. Open "AuthMyBB.php" from this archive in a text editor.

2. Change the line:
   --
   var $forum_path = "../forums/";
   --

   To point to the path of your copy of MyBB. For example, the default value
   assumes your copy of MyBB is in its own directory above the MediaWiki directory.

3. Upload "AuthMyBB.php" to your MediaWiki directory

4. Open LocalSettings.php (MediaWiki directory) and before the trailing ?> (last line)
   add the following:

   ---
   require_once( './AuthMyBB.php' );
   $wgAuth = new AuthMyBB();
   $wgGroupPermissions['*']['autocreateaccount'] = true;
   --

5. Attempt to login to MediaWiki using a MyBB account. It should log you in and give you
   the appropriate level of access.
